# Performance Gates

agentsview has repeatedly shipped performance regressions where sync work
stopped scaling with *new data* and started scaling with *archive size*. This
document records the regression classes we have actually hit, and the gates that
now guard each one. When you touch a sync or DB hot path, know which gate covers
you; when you fix a new class of regression, add a gate here.

The watcher scheduler, bounded watcher batches, and Codex continuation cursor
contracts are documented in
[Background Sync Efficiency](background-sync-efficiency.md).

## Regression history

| Class                          | What happened                                                                                                                                                                                           | Fixed in                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery O(sources) root work | Gemini rebuilt its project map per session; positron/vscode-copilot re-read `workspace.json` per session. A large store spent 2m47s in discovery.                                                       | #912                                           |
| Unchanged sources reparsed     | The provider migration dropped pre-parse DB-freshness skips; every full sync reparsed and rewrote untouched sessions.                                                                                   | `providerSourceUnchangedInDB` (#883 follow-up) |
| O(history) incremental appends | Every streamed line ran a full signal recompute (reload all messages, secret regex scan) and chunk merges delete+reinserted every message row. ~4,700 session updates/day each paid O(session history). | #954                                           |
| Bulk ingest throughput         | Full resync ran per-row inserts and rebuilt FTS incrementally; 26.7k sessions took 1m17s.                                                                                                               | #411                                           |
| Event storms                   | One SSE emit per watcher flush drove ~1/s dashboard refetch; SQLite WAL sidecar events fanned out to every session in a shared DB.                                                                      | #367, #956                                     |
| Per-row query shape            | `GetDailyUsage` ran 1.2M `json_extract` calls per scan and had no date pushdown.                                                                                                                        | #309                                           |

## Two layers of gates

### 1. Deterministic work-count invariants (run in `make test`)

These count work units instead of measuring time, so they are immune to CI
runner noise and fail loudly:

- `TestWarmFullSyncDoesNoBulkWriteWork` (`internal/sync/perf_invariant_test.go`)
  — a second full sync over an unchanged Claude archive must skip everything
  and run zero bulk-write batches (`Engine.PhaseStats`).
- `TestProviderAuthoritativeUnchangedSessionSkipsOnResync`
  (`internal/sync/provider_freshness_integration_test.go`) — the generic
  freshness skip for provider-authoritative agents, Vibe as representative.
- `TestWriteIncrementalDebouncesSignalRecompute` and the rest of
  `internal/sync/signal_schedule_test.go` — streaming appends must debounce
  the O(history) signal recompute.
- The count-based seam tests in `internal/parser`
  (`discovery_workspace_manifest_test.go`, gemini/antigravity provider tests)
  — root-derived project info is built once per root, not once per source.
- `internal/server/broadcaster_test.go` — SSE emits coalesce to at most one
  broadcast per window.
- `TestWatcherBatchesPathsAndEnforcesDispatchFloor`,
  `TestWatcherSustainedWritesProgress`,
  `TestWatcherContinuesIntakeDuringCallback`, and
  `TestWatcherOverflowRunsFullSyncThenRetainsLaterBatch`
  (`internal/sync/watcher_test.go`) — watcher callbacks remain throttled and
  serialized, sustained writes make progress, event intake continues during a
  sync, and an event storm becomes a bounded full rescan.
- `TestCodexCursorCache`, `TestCodexCursorWarmColdParity`, and the cursor
  boundary tests in `internal/parser` — continuation state stays bounded and
  warm/cold parsing remains equivalent at safe offsets.
- `TestIncrementalSync_CodexAppend`,
  `TestIncrementalSync_CodexLifecycleTailUpdatesTermination`, the partial-tail
  tests, and the late-update/title tests in
  `internal/sync/engine_integration_test.go` — safe Codex growth appends only
  new rows while lifecycle metadata, incomplete records, title changes, and
  retroactive updates preserve full-parse behavior.
- `TestCountDuplicatePromptsAllocationGrowthStaysNearLinear`
  (`internal/signals/heuristics_test.go`) — session-quality analysis must not
  rebuild token sets for every pair of user prompts.

When you fix a performance bug, prefer adding a gate at this layer: expose or
reuse a counter (`SyncStats`, `PhaseStats`, `AnomalyStats`, a swappable
package-var seam) and assert the invariant, e.g. "second sync parses zero
sessions" or "the manifest is read once per root regardless of session count".

### 2. Benchmark gate (runs on every PR via `bench.yml`)

`.github/workflows/bench.yml` runs `make bench-gate` — the single source of
truth for the gated package list, sample count, and iteration count — on the PR
head and its merge base on the same runner, then compares the outputs with
`cmd/benchgate`:

- `BenchmarkSyncAllWarmNoop` — full sync over an already-synced archive (stat +
  skip work only; also self-asserts nothing is re-synced or bulk-rewritten).
- `BenchmarkSyncPathsIncrementalAppend` — absorb one appended line into a
  1,000-message session.
- `BenchmarkCodexIncrementalSyncReads` — a warm Codex cursor append plus the
  remaining full-source fingerprint and committed-prefix hash reads. See
  [Background Sync Efficiency](background-sync-efficiency.md) for the
  cost-model boundary.
- `BenchmarkSyncAllColdArchive` — first-sync ingest throughput through the
  default per-session write path.
- `BenchmarkResyncBulkIngest` — the same archive through the resync bulk-write
  pipeline (`writeBatchBulk` / `DB.WriteSessionBatch`, the #411 regression
  class); self-asserts every session took the batch path.
- `BenchmarkReplaceSessionMessagesStreamingMerge` — the streaming chunk-merge
  diff path (one UPDATE, not a full delete+reinsert).
- `BenchmarkInsertMessagesBatch` — multi-row batched ingest.
- `BenchmarkGetDailyUsage` — usage aggregation over 100k message rows.
- `BenchmarkScan` / `BenchmarkScanDefinite` — secret-scan regex throughput.
- `BenchmarkCountDuplicatePromptsLargeSession` — duplicate-prompt analysis over
  a long session with shared vocabulary and distinct prompt context.

`benchgate` builds on `golang.org/x/perf`: `benchfmt` parses the output and
`benchmath` — the statistics engine behind `benchstat` — summarizes samples and
tests significance (Mann-Whitney U). benchgate adds only the policy benchstat
does not provide: thresholds, floors, and a failing exit code. Gating is per
benchmark — any single benchmark over its threshold fails the PR; nothing is
averaged across benchmarks. It gates hard on `allocs/op` (limit 1.25x) and
`B/op` (1.35x), which are deterministic for the same code and iteration count —
an O(archive)-instead-of-O(delta) regression always blows them up. Those two
compare the candidate's *worst* `-count` run against the baseline median, so
even an intermittent extra-allocation path fails. That is intentionally
asymmetric: the baseline is treated as the historical reference, and candidate
instability is what blocks the PR (failure lines include the baseline's worst
run so pre-existing instability is visible). Time (`sec/op`) compares medians
with a loose 2.0x limit and must additionally be a statistically significant
difference before it fails, so a single slow run on a noisy runner cannot flake
a PR but algorithmic blowups still do. Time gating requires at least 5 candidate
samples; fewer is reported as a configuration error (the candidate run is under
the workflow's control), while a baseline with fewer than 5 samples — a
legitimately partial base run — is reported and not gated. Baselines below a
per-metric floor are not gated. Benchmarks that exist on only one side are
reported but never fail, so adding or removing benchmarks cannot wedge a PR.
Only `allocs/op`, `B/op`, and `sec/op` are gated: custom `b.ReportMetric` units
are collected and reported as ungated, never enforced.

Two failure modes are treated as loud configuration errors (exit 2) rather than
silent gaps: a capture whose result lines fail to parse (for example test log
output interleaved into a `Benchmark...` line — the sync benchmarks silence the
engine's logger for exactly this reason), and a gated unit present in the
baseline but missing from the candidate (for example a candidate captured
without `-benchmem`), which would otherwise silently disable that gate for good.
The reverse — a gated unit missing from the baseline, which may legitimately be
older or partial — is reported as not gated.

The gate always runs with a fixed `-benchtime=Nx` iteration count (not a
duration): two of the benchmarks grow their fixture as they iterate, so the
baseline and candidate must run the same number of iterations to measure
identical workloads. CI evaluates `make bench-gate-config` on the PR head and
passes the count and benchtime into the merge-base run, so a PR that changes
those defaults still compares identical workloads; do the same locally if you
override them.

Report identifiers are package-qualified benchmark names
(`github.com/skillsgo/agentsview/internal/db.InsertMessagesBatch-18`) when the captured
output carries `pkg:` metadata, falling back to the bare name when it does not
(e.g. hand-trimmed captures). Do not mix captures with and without `pkg:` lines:
the same benchmark would key differently and be treated as removed/new.

Run locally, comparing your working tree against a baseline commit. Like CI, use
a worktree for the baseline — checking out or stashing in place can leave
candidate files (or your commits) in the baseline run:

```bash
make bench-gate > new.txt                # candidate: current tree
git worktree add /tmp/bench-base "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)"
make -C /tmp/bench-base bench-gate > old.txt
git worktree remove /tmp/bench-base
go run ./cmd/benchgate -old old.txt -new new.txt
```

Cross-backend query benchmarks live separately in `internal/backendbench`
(`make bench-backends`, requires Docker) and are not part of the PR gate.

`BenchmarkCodexIncrementalCursor` lives in `internal/parser` and compares cold
prefix reconstruction with an exact warm cursor. It is diagnostic rather than
PR-gated: `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES` currently contains `./internal/sync`,
`./internal/db`, `./internal/secrets`, and `./internal/signals`.

## Adding a benchmark to the gate

Every benchmark in a gated package is gated — there is no per-name allowlist to
maintain. A benchmark added by a PR has no baseline, so its first run is
reported without gating; it gates automatically once merged.

1. Write the benchmark next to the code it guards (`*_bench_test.go`,
   `b.ReportAllocs()`, self-assert the invariant it protects where possible).
   If the code under test logs, silence the logger in the benchmark (see
   `silenceBenchLogs` in `internal/sync/engine_bench_test.go`): interleaved
   log output corrupts result lines and benchgate fails on the corruption.
1. If its package is not already gated, add it to `BENCH_GATE_PACKAGES` in the
   Makefile — a benchmark outside the gated packages silently never runs, so
   it looks gated while measuring nothing. CI picks the list up from the
   Makefile; each side of the comparison benchmarks its own commit's list, so
   growing the gate cannot break the base run.
1. Keep per-op cost roughly in the 100µs–100ms band: below the benchgate floors
   nothing is gated, and far above it the job gets slow.
1. Keep per-iteration setup out of the timed region (`b.ResetTimer`, pre-built
   fixtures): helper allocations inside the loop are gated as if they were
   product cost and dilute or distort the ratio.
1. If the benchmark's fixture grows across iterations, say so in its comment;
   the fixed `-benchtime=Nx` keeps both sides comparable, but readers need to
   know per-op cost depends on the iteration count.
